Manifestella
Information exists universally, whereas ideas, norms, and laws of private
property are merely products of some human societies. Trying to imprison
information in these norms or laws is misguided, serves only the greed of
a few, and is doomed to fail eventually: such a great and powerful thing as
information cannot remain trapped in such a small cage for long.

Every time you click "Agree" to some lengthy, unreadable gibberish with which
you most likely don't agree, you sign away a little bit of your human dignity
and free will. If you actually do agree with what I've written here, then
feel free to copy and use this code in a manner consistent with it. If not,
email me first, and I'll be happy to discuss it.

Many thanks,
